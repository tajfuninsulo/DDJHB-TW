![](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/figs/incoming/04-00-cover.png)

So, you’re all ready to get started on your first data journalism project. What now? First of all you need some data. This section looks at where you can get it from. We learn how to find data on the web, how to request it using freedom of information laws, how to use ‘screen-scraping’ to gather data from unstructured sources and how to use ‘crowd-sourcing’ to collect your own datasets from your readers. We look at what the law says about republishing datasets, and how to use simple legal tools to let others reuse your data. Finally the section closes with some anecdotes and war stories about what our contributors have gone through to get hold of the data they were looking for.
